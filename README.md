# Minecraft-Recipe-Tweaks-for-Dummies
Simple datapack modifying recipes to increase laziness.

I started using https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/ to make recipes easier.

## Recipes
- rotten flesh can be smelted to make leather, with different speeds depending
  on which block is used (campfire < smoker < furnace < blast furnace)
- white wool -> 2x string
- string + paper -> name tag
- iron bars + planks -> rails (original rail recipe, but with bars and planks,
  to use more wood and less iron)
