Simple datapack modifying recipes to increase laziness.

## Recipes
- 9x rotten flesh -> 2x leather

I intended the first recipe to involve a furnace, but apparently JSON can't be used to add furnace recipes? Perhaps I should've added a fuel requirement to compensate for this. Gunpowder has similar chemicals to curing processes for leather iirc, so I might add that in place of the center rotten flesh..
